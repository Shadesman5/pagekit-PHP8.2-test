# pagekit-PHP8.2-test
This is the copy of uarend Pagekit version and upgraded to PHP 8.2. Unfortunately saving doesn't work. Saving is only possible under Settings. I just copied all the files on the server, so I don't know if it will work for you. Server must be set to PHP 8.2. Backend: admin dennis19959!
